# A fun story to share

I was chatting with my very good friend from undergrad about life and being a software dev and junk and we both realized something about ourselves (or idk at least I realized something about myself :P) We don't much care about computer science unless it's for work lol

We basically only care about it because it's cool and awesome and sh\*t, not because it'll make us a bunch of money (though, idk that's why I originally joined CSC at NC State lol ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜­), not because it'll get us hot partners, not because it'll make people like us...

We like computer science and we like our jobs because it's just super duper cool what we can do with it. Like we can have fun outside of looking up what the fastest version of a computer does or whatever. I've had Kubernetes and Docker explained to me a million times, but it didn't even make sense until this friend told me what she does with it! lol

So like I enjoy different dev tools that work for you, that make your life easier, Flutter Flow is perhaps my favorite tool there is, and iOS/macOS Storyboards are my second favorite (drag and drop programming). These tools help you build really nice layouts easy peasy. Are Storyboards a pain because of git issues? Yes, absolutely, but also idk you just learn how to use Git and then bam! You know how to do anything. 

Honestly, I think the only tool you for real for real need to learn as a developer is how to use Git. If you know how to use that, you can build whatever you want to with anyone in the world. It's not easy to learn, but once you've learned it, you're automatically the best developer there ever was.

I mean, look at me lol I'm using Github to host my blog :P Perhaps it's goofy, and unconventional, but it works! Also I enjoy their markdown editor lol sue me :P

Also if I wanted to in the future I could probably find a tool that could host my markdown pages and then bam beautiful blog. This blog is mostly for other developers to read though, so I just.. this is what I'm doing now ahaha :P

# Open Door

So I was recently working on Open Door with my friend Elizabeth and... I tried using all the stuff that other backend devs tell me I should work with. I used Docker, I tried using mysql (haven't used it since school lol) and I was just like this all sucks! ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜­ I suck! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜­  I don't know how to use any of these tools anymore and Elizabeth isn't here to help me lmao :P

So I just.. opened her repo up and actually looked at it in an IDE that makes it make sense and then I was like oh dang lol I can read this. I don't need swagger or docker or whatever, I don't need any of the tools that I thought I did. I just became comfy with using those things because other devs asked me to :P

I just read her code and I was like "oh, yeah lol I know how to read this stuff I can just translate this so I can use it :P" duhhhhhhh lololol oh well.

# For Recruiters and New Devs

I'm gonna type in some tools and you can input this into the googs/bing/duckduckgo whatever your favorite search engine is, and then whatever thing you wanna make and then hopefully it'll give you what you want. So for example the way you'd use this is:

[tool] + [problem you're having/error you're getting] + [language you're using]

For example:

watchOS view isn't loading properly objective c

or you can shorten it if you wanna:

ios view not loading objc

:D easy peasy

## Backend-type stuff:

I'm gonna put languages I know you can use with these tools, but I'm sure there are other languages you can use, I just... you can look that up lol I don't wanna :P Also, I'm def not a backend engineer, I just know how to work with 'em ahahaha ðŸ˜…

- Docker (python)
- MySQL (java)
- Amazon Web Service (c#, c++)
- Hibernate (java)
- Kubernetes (idk lol ask the googs :P all I know is that it helps you maintain B I G  D A T A lol probably golang? maybe python? idk ahaha)

## Frontend stuff:

I'll list the stuff that I know how to use the best :3 some of 

- Angular, Cordova, Ionic (is just.. is cordova lol), Xamarin, React (cross platform tools)
- iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS blah blah other Apple made stuff you get it :P (swift, objc, swiftui)
- Android (to search for problems with this tho you have to use the actual tool you're using ex: AR Core, Watch OS, etc. I think the googs calls em products or platforms :P)

----

idk it really feels like you gotta know every dev tool in order to get hired somewhere. It's weird. I can't keep up with all these tools and stuff I don't even like the new tools that most devs use lol! Perhaps this is the old man in me talking, but I really just hate SwiftUI and Dart. Can I use it? Of course! I don't really want to, unless my job calls for it ahaha! ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚

But I really really hate declarative languages. There I said it :'D whew. Felt good to get that out. I said some pretty meh stuff on my previous blog post about langauges, though idk, maybe it was inflamatory ðŸ˜… I don't remember, but I never said I hated anything. I just I really do hate declarative stuff and programmatic stuff. It honestly just takes me a million more years to implement. 

Can I do it? Yes. Do I enjoy it? Nah. Will I do it? Yes. Absolutely I will if my team asks me for it.

I know how to read programming languages and I know how to read documentation, it takes me a while, but I can do it. 

and you know what? You can too, you just honestly gotta practice making cool sh\*t ðŸ˜„
