So I wrote a crappy app for BART a while ago and I remembered when I wrote it and why I wrote it.

My dad works for BART. He isn't a fan of it lol no one is :P No one likes BART, not even the people they employ I guess.

I wanted to make an app that was simple and cool. I made a crappy little thing lol it was the worst thing I've ever made, I think. I dunno why I even thought it would be good enough to put on my resume.

I made that app when I was on a really not good medication called Gabapentin. Perhaps it helped me because I was able to use my legs again, I could walk, but it did not help me because I was literally stupid. Like I'm pretty sure I was clinically "dumb" and I never want to feel like that again. I hope my worst enemy never feels that way either.

That app looks like garbage lol! but it did use BART's api, which is weird ahaha at least, it was weird when I used it. It might have been cleaned up and maybe it's better now, but I just... had a hard time with it haha. Maybe because of the medication I was on, maybe because I wasn't as experienced as I am now... either way I'm just appalled at myself for putting that garbage onto my github lol

I will say, I think it's pretty cool that I did Android stuff with it and that's how I learned that I wouldn't like to do Android development for my job :P I'll do it for fun! ahaha!
