So I wrote a scathing review for a company that starts with m and ends with eta and about how they treated me in my interview process and... I truly think interviewing in the tech industry really stinks :P it's really not fun.

I keep getting phone calls instead of video calls now, and it makes me sad because I don't know what to do when people don't speak. I actually hate phone calls because I can't see facial expressions and I don't know what's happening so I will pause to make sure they are listening. Then they don't say anything, and then I ask stupid questions to make sure they're still listening ðŸ˜­ but it's honestly not on purpose ðŸ˜­ and I stutter and stammer because of it. It's just the worst haha! ðŸ¥²

A conversation that recently happened:

### Them: 
> "So do you know what Swift is?"

### Me: 
*?? yes?? I put it in my resume of course I know what swift is...*
> "... yes! I work with it every day... it's a programming language....... like java........ " 

*why aren't they saying anything??*

### Them:
> "..."

### Me: 
*what do I do?? do I keep going? what do I say? how do I...*

> "mmm... it's like java..." 

*I wish they would say, 'yeah I know what java is' or something, anything!!!* ðŸ˜­

> "you uh... you know what a programming language is?" 

*oh my god whyyyy are you why did you ask that stop being so nervous and just speak!*

### Them:

> *scoffs* yes, I know what a programming language is.

### Me:

*is dead. hates life. will think about this forever and die thinking about the fact that I asked that stupid ass question.*
