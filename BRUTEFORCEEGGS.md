# Asking a dev to do leetcode is like asking a chef to make an egg ü•ö

There's a ton of different ways a chef can cook an egg. 

There are simple and nice ways and there are also stupid and poopy bad ways to make an egg.

Is there a way to cook an egg and make it inedible? Absolutely. 

Can you cook an egg and make it the most devine, beautiful, delicious thing you've ever made? Also yes.

### Food for thought! üç≥

Cooking an egg should be the simplest test for a cook. Some chefs hate eggs tho lol, some just think they're repulsive. Some don't like to cook them in a certain way, and some even only like making scrambled eggs. Some only like making poached eggs. One is much more difficult in technique, and you can mess up a poached egg way faster than you can mess up scrambled eggs.

Leetcode is like if someone asked you to write instructions on how to make the egg that you wanna make. So like I'd say a brute force way to cook an egg would be like:

- grab an egg
- heat a pan on medium
- crack the contents of the egg into the pan
- stir egg vigorously until cooked

bam scrambled eggs.

if my mother dearest told you how to make scrambled eggs:

- obtain 10 eggs
- crack 10 eggs into a bowl and mix with a fork until it's yellow and frothy, no egg whites should be left
- add salt, pepper, and onion powder to the bowl of eggs, then stir to combine
- heat large pan and put a hefty pad of butter, enough to coat the bottom of the pan, and then a lot more üßà <sub>(don't lie mom, I know this is how you make your delicious eggs when I was a kid)</sub>
- when the butter is melted, pour eggs into the pan and slowly stir the eggs until it looks slightly underdone (it will be a little shiny), fear not, the eggs will cook still in the minutes before the person that is eating it will actually eat it
- serve with cheese and chives


and I mean so like. both are recipes for scrambled eggs, but which one do you actually wanna eat? 

To me, it doesn't matter as long as I get results and those results better be delicious!!

## Leetcode is making those dang eggs

I feel like leetcode is just... making eggs. Any chef worth their salt should be able to make eggs easy peasy, and they should be the best gat dang eggs you've ever eaten because they're so easy to make.

Doesn't matter if the chef doesn't like eggs. Doesn't matter if the chef had a bad experience with eggs in the past. Doesn't matter if they have an allergy to eggs. Chefs should be able to make an egg and it should be edible, and if they're a good chef, then it'll taste good.

<b>I feel like leetcode doesn't show if you are *good* at computer science. It should just show if you can do computer science.</b>

### GASP. Spud, how dare you??

lol I mean yeah, do you really need to have a computer science degree to be a software dev? nah.

Should you have one to be a good one? sure. Don't explicitly need one, but it'd be cool and good to show that you at least heard of certain concepts before. But really, honestly, if you don't have those fundamentals it's just... more difficult.

### Homework anecdote üìö

Once upon a time I was helping a friend with their computer science homework recently and another person was also helping them. This person did not go to school, but they wanted to use all these super fancy and cool tools to get their stuff done...

I was like, "no just look at your professor's notes, try to pay attention in class, and if you do what they ask you to, you'll get a good grade." The person that didn't go to school said, "just because they didn't go to school doesn't mean they don't know how to do things." Woo boy howdy! >:'D

I said, "okay lol" and I stopped helping because... idk lol I was just letting him know how I got through school. It was hard, but its was only hard because you just had to figure out what your TA or professor was trying to look for in your work. Not because you had to find every cool tool to help you do your homework. In fact, some schools (mine) didn't allow you to use certain tools to do your homework. You just had to use the stuff your professor gave you. 

ü§î I don't even remember google being super useful to me in my later classes except for when I was building projects. The actual homework parts of classes, like the theory parts where they teach you computer science fundamentals, that stuff was all stuff from professors. 

And so, unfortunately, a lot of that stuff I don't remember how to do any more. üò¢ I don't even remember how to use assembly anymore. I'm sure if i took the time to relearn it I could, but I didn't even do well in that class even though it was quite honestly a very fun class.

Also, I don't remember exactly how to build a binary search every time. I just don't have that memorized. I don't think it's useful to me. I think <b>just in time learning</b> is a more useful tool to have than memorizing junk.

# Okay Spud, tell us your actual real thoughts on this leetcode junk

I think leetcode should measure if you know at least some computer science concepts.

I think leetcode should not measure if you are <b>good</b> at implementing computer science concepts.

Like okay. You <sub>(hopefully you're not a super fancy chef or something, or maybe you are idk lol)</sub> can memorize the first egg recipe super easy peasy.

But the second recipe you can do once you've had a lil more experience, or you know, even if you have more experience, don't fix what ain't broke! Or, learn how to do new stuff! lol üòÑ

# Okay now bring it back to eggs and stuff:

I guess my point of this is: I love eggs and I also love brute force implementations. As long as you can tell me why it's not good to do or how you can improve it, then it's fine :P Tell me why my dry and crispy eggs are better or worse than my mom's fluffy delicious eggs üòÇ
