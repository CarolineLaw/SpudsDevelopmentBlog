# Smiles

they're nice to show, they're nice to be given, they're nice :3

### why did that person not smile at me when I expected them to??

hmm this is a good question. let's examine it from a dev's perspective, so maybe this person:

- just refactored something and it took a long time and you tried to crack a joke at them and it really just... it didn't land ğŸ˜… bc you know lol they are tired from the refactoring ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜­
- had a weird lunch and their tum tum hurts and now everything is pain. they really gotta poo. and they're at work where it's not comfy for them to poo ğŸ˜¢ğŸ˜­
- had someone else say something super mean to them and they don't feel good about it but they gotta keep a straight face and not be sad about it lol
- just doesn't like you ğŸ˜²ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜¢
- worked on something new for a long time, realized there was an easier way to do this and is super upset (dis me a lot ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜…ğŸ˜­)


let's look at this from a regular ordinary mortal's perspective, so maybe this person:

- had bad/weird teeth when they were younger and so it's super hard for them to smile
- is just feeling in the dumps today or maybe this week or maybe this month. maybe even this year :[
- just doesn't like you ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­
- doesn't know how to smile lol they try to smile and they look terrifying ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­

idk lol there are a whole lot of reasons why someone might have not smiled at you. and you just gotta be okay with it :P just gotta be cool with the fact that some people really just might not uh they might not uhhh

- wanna hang out with you
- want to be your friend
- get food with you
- want to be cool with you

but please remember. they don't have to do these things, but what they must do. what they should do, and kind of have to do. 

*is at least respect you.* 

and if they don't respect you, just leave. leave the room, the situation, the thread, the job, the uh lmao the country ğŸ˜…ğŸ˜‚

idk how to end this post so, uhhh

### ty for coming to my ted talk ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚
