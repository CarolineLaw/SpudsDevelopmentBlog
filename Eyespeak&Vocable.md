<p>WillowTree was a pretty awesome place to work right out of college. I feel super lucky and privileged&nbsp;to have been able to work there. On my maybe third day of work I was sent to Charlottesville, VA (yeah you know the one) to their headquarters for</p>

<p>Innovation Day was a day of creating, it was the one day of the year(? maybe quarter? I don't remember) when you could build something to help your work or something that was innovative and creative. Some people were using this time to mess with ARKit, Apple's relatively new augmented reality framework. It was my third day on the job and I had no idea what I was doing, so I just used this time to download Xcode and figure out how to become an iOS dev. At the end of the day a coworker of mine showed me what he was working on and it blew me away. I'm going to try to describe it, probably fail, and then just show you a picture that I drew of what happened.</p>

<p>My coworker showed me an app he had made using ARKit that followed where your eyes were looking on your screen. It looked hilarious because on the screen you see yourself, with two red laser looking things shooting out of your eyeballs. If I remember correctly, it was incredibly janky, didn't follow your eyes the whole time, but it did work sometimes, and come on this guy only had probably less than eight hours to build this thing and I thought it was amazing. This is what it looked like:</p>

<p>I thought it was pretty amazing and I didn't think about it again for a couple years. I worked as an iOS dev for two years on different projects I'll talk about another time. A couple days before Innovation Day rolls around again, this time it's late 2019, and another coworker asks me if I want to help work on Eyespeak. I ask what is Eyespeak and he tells me it's an app that tracks your eyes and helps those who can't speak. I thought about Innovation Day 2018 and about my other coworker's work. "Is that what [other coworker's name redacted] was working on last year?" Yes. I felt really bad though because I had already agreed to help someone else with something (I think it had to do with Amazon or something? I don't remember lol) so I declined, but I was intrigued.</p>

<p>Later on in 2019, maybe even early 2020, I get notified somehow that people were going to work on Eyespeak. That this Innovation Day project was going to get a real team, and people were going to work on it for more than a couple days in a year. It was incredible and I thought about how cool it is that we get to work on a project that was my coworker's personal project. Some day I hope to learn how the conversation went in order to get the project approved. I saw the prototype on a tablet and how it was a keyboard that you could use your eyes to select letters. It was amazing and I wanted to be a part of it. The prototype was on an iOS device, and there were already very talented iOS engineers a part of the team, they didn't need any more iOS devs. I begged to be a part of the team, I told them I'd even learn Android development and they said yes, I could be on the team.</p>

<p>We had a full team including a researcher that I convinced to join the team (then she had to ask her boss if it was okay, long story short we got her). Two designers were also on the team and with the researcher they came up with the name Vocable Augmentative and Alternative Communication, or Vocable AAC. Along with developers on the team (3 iOS, 3 Android) they found out it would be better if instead of using eye tracking, that head tracking be used because there were more devices that had the technology for head tracking. If I remember correctly, eye tracking was only on relatively expensive devices and we wanted this to be as accessible as possible. We also found out with the help of our researcher that instead of using a keyboard, it would be more helpful to our target users if there were full sentences that they could choose from, that way the didn't need to use their head to type everything out every time. So we came up with this:</p>
