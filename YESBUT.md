# I am going to talk about "yes, but" today

Actually first I'm going to talk about, "no, but" and just "no" first.

### No, but

This is what people say most of the time in software development. Sometimes in life, but a lot in software development. 

Usually people will say:

"No, but have you considered this?"

"No, but we have a lot of time."

"No, but we have some money."

"No, but we have a few resources."

This stinks, but at least they give positive considerations. That's nice :D

### No

Sometimes people will say:

"No, it's impossible."

"No, it takes too much time."

"No, it's too expensive."

"No, we don't have any resources."

This truly feels the worst in software development. This feels like you really can't get anything done.

### Yes, but

This is my favorite. I love "YES, but":

"Yes, but it will be difficult!"

"Yes, but our timeline will be crunched."

"Yes, but it costs more."

"Yes, but we don't have many resources."

This is my favorite because it's only positive, because I feel this approach gives more options. I think saying, "yes, but" makes people more collaborative. It helps people think of ideas on how to get to that YES!!! NO BUTS!!!! >:'D

and I think that's pretty cool and good 👍 😎
