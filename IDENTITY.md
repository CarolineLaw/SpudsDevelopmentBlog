# What is I D E N I T Y?


> "the fact of being who or what a person or thing is."
>    - the googs


It's what defines you. It's what lets you know who you are and what you care about.

I think in my life, especially recently, I've pushed away things that I hold dear to me. Things that I love because I think it will help me with boundaries and my own feelings. Including my own identity. I've let others sort of define who I am in terms of "what I do" because I've had someone close to me tell me that "what I do" doesn't define who I am. Which is fair, but...

I'm not so sure about that anymore. I have thoughts and feelings, and I'd love for others to chat with me about them because I love feedback lol but um.

# Food for thought

I recently just broke up with a friend because I realized I don't actually have that much in common with them fundamentally, even though on paper, we look like we should be best friends.

On paper, we should hang out every day and get lunch and grow up together, become old together. Fundamentally though... we should not hang out. Shoulda seen the way they hold macbooks! ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜­
