# Why is it important to Spud?

So accessibility is important to me because I really do believe you should try to make your apps for everyone. I understand there are some companies that say they don't really care much for making their apps for the majority of people, just the people that can afford it :'D

I think it's important to get feedback from as many people as you can and then be able to synthesize that feedback down to something you can use.
