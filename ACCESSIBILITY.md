# Why is it important to Spud?

So accessibility is important to me because I really do believe you should try to make your apps for everyone. I understand there are some companies that say they don't really care much for making their apps for the majority of people, just the people that can afford it, but I just... that makes me sad ahahaha

### sidenote:

I think... I really think Google is the power house here. I really think they are the leading force for good in the development world. Do they have all their shit together all the time? Is it very difficult to find how stuff works without having to look at joe schmuckatelly's blog posts? mmm... no, but I appreciate that I can do that. I appreciate Google's efforts to bring the development world together.
