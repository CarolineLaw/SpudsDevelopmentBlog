# Documentation

I know some devs will groan about documenting their code, some devs HATE writing comments on their code, and in some companies devs are even encouraged to NEVER document anything because they are fearful of weird stuff like theft or I dunno their mom is gonna come and spank them, I have no idea why developers are terrified to talk about what they are building.

I think documenting what you're writing is the most important thing in the world and I believe you should try your best with comments and self-documenting code. I think swift is the best for self-documenting code, and kotlin sucks because you don't know what you're writing, I don't know what you're writing, I feel like Google isn't even sure sometimes, but! It's okay because I feel like Google is okay with this since I'm sure their devs understand it, and I guess that's all that matters.

And I think this is the thing, I don't actually talk to anyone at Apple or Google about what they do because no one tells me nothing ever (or they do and I promptly forget it lol I've got too much on my mind) But I'm gonna share with you what my personal feelings are on the matter, in a sec ;D

So. You know how passionate I am for being able to read documentation right? :D

...No? That's okay lol I will show you how I am passionate about documentation. Also if you want to you can read about [my feelings on feedback here](https://spud.blog/2022/01/21/8-feedback-harden-your-heart-or-soften-your-soul/).

### A few reminders

I am a native mobile app dev. These opinions are my own, and remember they are just opinions. Anecdotal evidence is valuable, but it's not true until there's repeated patterns.

Also, I'm just gonna talk about Apple and Google because they're like the OG big boys in mobile app dev rn :P

## Apple

Their documentation is fairly good, and I would always tell people to read their own documentation AFTER looking at blog posts made by people like yours truly. I think once you learn how to read it, once you download their practice projects and see by example, it's fairly easy to implement it into your project.

However, I will also say that Apple documentation is good, but only after you've learned how to read it. I think becoming an iOS dev is incredibly difficult and not easy because you gotta:

- get a macbook (if you don't you're gonna have a hard time)
- learn how to read (wtf lol don't you know how to read stuff in school??)
- know swift or objc (this one is easy peasy I promise you, if I can do it, you can do it too lol)

Actually I think that might be it, but still, getting the macbook is already a difficult thing if you don't have money (I literally just was able to purchase mine, but I will have to tighten my spending budget as I live in SF and make 120k a year lol)

Anyways, I'm sure you're like "WHAT? I already know how to read" lol but um, there are words that Apple uses that seem very difficult, but honestly it's just semantics. It's just their inspeak :P It's just their dev's coded language so that they can talk about their work without ACTUALLY talking about their work.

### sidenote:

I feel like I remember being in a movie theater in Charlotte when I was going to university, where these guys were loudly talking about their work and how cool and good it was and they were talking in technical speak and I was like... You guys think you're saying a lot, but you're actually really just not at all saying anything. It was amazing. They were talking about APIs and stuff and how they implemented it and I'm sure my parents who I was with was like, "wow did you hear that? Those guys were talking about the stuff you do." and I was like "...were they??" lol like sure I do that for work now, but they're talking about baby stuff! Stuff that people must do on a regular day to day basis, and also, I'm a frontend person I don't care about how beautiful your backend REST APIs are, I will focus on what I want to focus on and let you do what you want to do.

Kinda felt like when my friend's dad tells me to fix their computers because I'm a computer science graduate lol but it's even more difficult to explain to my parents that, just because I know what REST APIs are, just because I studied and talked to people about their experiences with using Bootstrap, Django, Angular, Cordova, and other web technologies, doesn't mean I care about it. Just because I know how to use Charles Proxy (my super secret boyfriend that I did a presentation on), Postman, Swagger, and other API reading tools, doesn't mean I care which one we use! Just because I can read javascript, yaml, c++, c#, c, and even *gasp* objective-c doesn't mean I want to! Just because I'm the best gat dang XML reader on the earth and I can debug and read that stuff doesn't mean that's what I wanna do forever! Just because I know how to do some devops junk and I know git, Gitlab (sorta lol), and Github's stuff fairly intimately it doesn't mean I want to do that forever and ever :'D

I don't even put some of that stuff on my resume lol! But you can't say that to people, specially not your mom!! *That's super mean!!* lol 

Also lol it's kinda like when [I talk about baseball](https://spud.blog/2022/02/19/san-francisco-giants/) with some people: some people like it, others really really hate it.

Anyways, Apple has their own "dev speak". You just gotta figure it out and learn it and then BAM you can put their stuff in your stuff :P

[Take a look at Apple's ARKit documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit)

It's hella good!!!

## Google

They're the best. I love google. kinda lol. So Google is nice because they are incredibly accessibile to beginners. You can read any and all documentation as a beginner and it will even teach you how to implement some of it. However, once you're in the deep end. You're in it and there's no one to help you swim back to the kiddie pool lol

What you need to be able to read Google documentation:

- any laptop
- a 3rd grade reading level
- hope

because you better hope that what they're telling you is NOT out of date and that it's telling you the truth. Otherwise, you're going to just have to implement it and build it yourself. Even their own example projects sometimes don't work when you download them because they've already made a million changes to Android and how it works lol

And this is why open source is so much harder to work with :P

because you want EVERYONE. EVERYONE and EVERYTHING. To be able to read your stuff. But that means that some people do slip through the cracks sometimes. It means that some people really won't be able to read it and then they get sad and they feel left behind and they don't want to do it anymore. 

I mean take a look at [ARCore's documentation](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/getting-started)

This you can see that they need to write documentation for how to get started on like 6 different platforms! That's so many!!! ahaha! So of course they probably won't have time to write documentation on how to do other stuff because other people *have* written quality blog posts on this stuff. I would encourage new devs to look at Google's documentation BEFORE you read blog posts. 

But it's also very cool though because people like Samsung can look at your stuff and make their own stuff on top of it and then put bloatware and you have to make sure that your app works on every Samsung, Hwawei (.... mmmm... actually I think I read somewhere that the googs told Hwawei that they're not allowed to use android anymore lol probably some internet article, so I'm not sure if it's actually even true :P), LG, and other Android phones that there is. It's too much sometimes lol like I remember when we implemented the keyboard piece of the Vocable app we weren't allowed to put in predictive text because Samsung's stuff is proprietary and it would take too long for us to figure out how to implement it, but the iOS devs simply put it into the app no big deal because Apple only has to deal with it's own eco system :P

---

Anyways I feel like I blathered about stuff that didn't have to do with documentation, but it all kinda makes sense doesn't it? That these things would be true for companies that like to do that kinda stuff? That the documentation for Apple might work for some (like me) and Google would work for others (like me when I was first starting out lol).

But also idk take what I say with a big heaping heapful of salt because I don't actually know any of this for sure. I'm just shaing my observations :P

ANYWays see you in the next post :P
