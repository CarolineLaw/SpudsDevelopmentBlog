# Best Programming Language? 👀

Okay so before I begin, here are some swift resources that are super cool and good:

[Swift.org](https://www.swift.org/documentation/): Best documentation you'll ever read because.. it's the OG! lol it's what apple wants you to read in order to get gud at swift. It will (should) never tell you lies, because if it does, then it's a bad resource and swift is a bad language! 😂😭

[Use Your Loaf](https://useyourloaf.com/): Very excellent, explains what's going on and tells you why things are happening and also gives real good examples to follow imo. Also! There's really well made diagrams :D!

[Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/): My favorite swift resource that is concise and easy to read, and I really enjoy the examples. I like that Paul gives straight forward ways to fix your problems 👍😄

I will say, the 100 days of swift thing is fun and cool, but the exam at the end is like... really weird lol so like if you don't know semantics you won't know some of the questions, even though you technically do know some of the questions... Much much much like Apple lol! >:'D

[Ray Wenderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com/): Another good resource for learning how to do swift stuff. It's a lil more verbose, but still a good resource.

# Play in the Playground!!

When you're first starting out, I would highly recommend to start using Playground to get your feet wet. It's a cool and good resource to try and check your stuff and make sure your stuff kinda works before you jump right into building apps and stuff.

So like this is where I'd recommend doing your data structure and algorithm practice and junk :P

# Why Spud thinks Swift is so gat dang good:

- types/null handling
- apple made stuff is nice
-
