# 0 - An Introduction
<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>A super fun and cool intro into what this blog is and who I am</em></p>

<p>My name is [redacted] and my pronouns are they/them. I am also known as Spud because my name on a bunch of game platforms is <em>small potato</em> and Spud was just one of the thousands of potato names that stuck. Tiny Tater Tot was another good one, just didn't stick, it's not short enough I guess.</p>

<p>I have a tiny dog and a regular sized husband. I play a bunch of video games (Overwatch, Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, RDR2, etc.), I really like baseball, specifically my team is the San Francisco Giants, and I love to eat.</p>

<p>As for my career, I'm a Senior Software Engineer (iOS Developer) at Caterpillar Inc. Unfortunately I won't be talking about the work that I've done/am doing there because it's not as fun to talk about the stuff you're doing now you know? I will be talking about projects that I have worked on for fun and for my previous job. </p>

<p>The first project I want to talk about is Vocable AAC. I started on this project late during my time at WillowTree, but I want to talk about it first because it was the most exciting and fun project I've worked on. It's a completely free, open source, head tracking mobile app that helps those who cannot speak. I will be talking about the technical side of how we built some of it (this is gonna be extra fun for me because it was a while ago and I have to remember how we did everything), and I'll be talking about the other stuff I did to try to get people to work on it. If you want to you can check out Vocable on their website <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://vocable.app" target="_blank">here</a> or you can look at the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/willowtreeapps/vocable-ios" target="_blank">iOS github</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/willowtreeapps/vocable-android" target="_blank">Android github</a>.</p>
